# Ray Modeler ‚ñ≥

> **Editor's Note:** This is a passion project that I've been developing for the past year, primarily as a learning exercise. It is not intended for commercial use but rather as a tool to help others explore, learn, and understand Radiance simulations and how they can improve building design.
> Please consider this a **beta version**. The intent is to improve it over time, but many features have not been extensively tested. If you run into a bug, your feedback would be greatly appreciated!

Ray Modeler is a web-based graphical user interface for the Radiance Lighting Simulation Suite. It streamlines the entire daylighting and electric lighting analysis workflow, from parametric 3D modeling to simulation script generation and advanced results visualization.

Designed for lighting designers, architects, and building science researchers, Ray Modeler provides an intuitive, interactive environment to model, simulate, and analyze lighting performance in single-zone spaces without needing to write Radiance code manually.

## ‚ú® Core Capabilities

Ray Modeler is packed with features that automate and enhance the Radiance workflow:

- **Parametric Scene Modeling**: Visually define room dimensions, orientation, window-to-wall ratios (WWR), and complex shading devices like overhangs, light shelves, louvers, and roller shades.

- **Geometry Importer**: Import complex models from `.obj` files, with an interactive UI to tag surfaces (walls, floors, glazing) for accurate simulation setup.

- **Context & Site Modeling**: Improve simulation accuracy by adding surrounding context, either through simple massing tools, topography from heightmaps, or by automatically fetching building data from OpenStreetMaps.

- **Interior Furniture Library**: Place simple furniture and partition objects from a pre-built library via drag-and-drop to create more realistic interior scenes.

- **Radiance Material Editor**: Configure standard Radiance materials (`plastic`, `metal`, `glass`) by adjusting properties like reflectance, specularity, and roughness. It also supports spectral data (`.dat`) files for advanced material definitions.

- **Advanced Glazing Systems**: Model glazing using simple transmittance values or incorporate complex fenestration data via Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function (BSDF) `.xml` files. The application correctly converts intuitive transmittance to physically-based transmissivity for simulations.

- **Interactive BSDF Viewer**: Demystify complex glazing by providing immediate visual feedback. When a BSDF `.xml` file is loaded, the application can parse the Klems matrix and render an interactive 2D polar plot showing the angular distribution of transmitted light for any incident angle.

- **Electric Lighting Design**: Place and configure multiple Radiance light source types (light, spotlight, glow, illum) or import real-world luminaire data using IES photometric files in individual or grid-based layouts.

- **Advanced IES Photometry Viewer**: In addition to a 2D polar plot, visualize luminaire distributions with an interactive 3D photometric web and view key metadata like lumens and wattage directly from the `.ies` file.

- **Daylighting Controls**: Simulate energy savings by implementing photosensor-controlled lighting systems with continuous, stepped, or off modes.

- **Daylighting Control Zone Visualization**: Instantly visualize which luminaires are controlled by which photosensors with color-coded 3D gizmos, providing immediate feedback on the daylighting strategy.

- **Automated Radiance Workflow**: Generates a complete, organized project folder structure (e.g., 01_geometry, 04_skies, 07_scripts) and populates it with geometry files, material definitions, sensor points, and executable run scripts for both Windows (`.bat`) and macOS/Linux (`.sh`).

- **First-Person View (FPV) Mode**: Enter the Radiance viewpoint camera directly to preview the exact perspective, fisheye, or parallel view that will be rendered for analysis.

- **Saved Camera Views ("Snapshots")**: Save and load specific camera positions and angles, complete with thumbnails, to quickly return to key perspectives during analysis.

- **Advanced Annual Analysis**: Generate and view temporal heatmaps, glare rose diagrams, and combined daylight/glare scatter plots to deeply understand annual performance.

- **Recipe-Based Simulation Engine**: Automate complex Radiance workflows with pre-configured "recipes." The application generates all necessary geometry files, material definitions, and executable run scripts (`.sh`, `.bat`) in a standardized project folder.

- **Advanced Annual Methods**: Support for industry-standard annual simulation methods, including 3-Phase and 5-Phase Daylight Analysis.

- **Spectral Lighting Analysis**: A full implementation of the Lark methodology to run multi-channel simulations and calculate non-visual lighting metrics like melanopic and neuropic illuminance.

- **Automated Compliance Workflows**: Specialized recipes for checking compliance with major industry standards, including `IES LM-83 (sDA/ASE)`, `EN 17037 (Daylight in Buildings)`, and `EN 12464-1 (Light and lighting of work places)`.

- **Interactive HDR Image Analysis**: View High-Dynamic Range (HDR) renderings with exposure controls, toggle false-color luminance mode, and use a mouse-over probe to get exact cd/m¬≤ values. Detected glare sources can be overlaid directly onto the image for verification.

- **Live Sun Ray Tracing**: Visualize direct sun penetration in real-time. Trace a grid of rays from the sun's current position (calculated from the EPW file for any date/time) through glazing surfaces and see how they bounce around the interior, helping to quickly identify potential glare spots or assess daylight distribution.

- **File System Integration**: Using the File System Access API (or Electron's APIs), Ray Modeler can directly read from and save to a local project folder, enabling a seamless desktop-like experience.
  
- **AI Assistant**: An integrated, context-aware AI chat powered by generative AI (Google Gemini or models via OpenRouter) that can answer questions and directly manipulate the scene, run simulations, and control the UI using natural language commands.

- **Automated Report Generation**: Generate comprehensive HTML reports with a single click. The report includes project details, a 3D scene snapshot, key performance metrics (sDA, ASE, DGP), and all generated dashboard charts (UDI, Glare Rose), ready for printing or saving as a PDF.

- **Interactive Data Table**: Inspect raw simulation data in a sortable, filterable table. Click on any row to instantly highlight the corresponding sensor point in the 3D model, linking numerical data directly to its spatial context.

- **Daylight Autonomy Heatmaps**: Visualize annual performance not just as point-in-time illuminance, but also as Daylight Autonomy (DA), showing the percentage of occupied hours that each sensor point meets a specific illuminance threshold.

- **Climate Data Analysis**: Generate an interactive dashboard from the loaded EPW file, including a wind rose, solar radiation charts, and temperature profiles to better understand the site context.

- **Advanced Circadian Health Dashboard**: Analyze results from spectral simulations to calculate and visualize key circadian lighting metrics like Circadian Stimulus (CS), Equivalent Melanopic Lux (EML), and check for compliance with WELL building standards.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use Ray Modeler, you will need a modern web browser and a local installation of the Radiance Lighting Simulation Suite.
The desktop version provides the most seamless experience.

1. **Install Radiance**:
   Download and install [Radiance](https://www.radiance-online.org/) from the official website or the [NREL](https://github.com/NREL/Radiance) GitHub repository. Ensure the Radiance `bin` directory is in your system's PATH.

2. **Download Ray Modeler**:
   Download the latest release for your operating system (macOS or Windows) from the project's Releases page.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - *Windows*: Run the Ray Modeler Setup X.X.X.exe installer.
   - *macOS*: Open the Ray Modeler-X.X.X.dmg and drag the application to your Applications folder.

Security Warnings on First Launch:

Because the application is not yet code-signed, your operating system will likely show a security warning. When a user on a Mac downloads and tries to open the unsigned app, they will be stopped by Gatekeeper, which will show a message like "Ray Modeler cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified."

- **On Windows (SmartScreen)**: Click "**More info**", then click "**Run anyway**".

- **On macOS (Gatekeeper)**: **Right-click** (or Control-click) the app icon, select "**Open**" from the menu. A new dialog box will appear that is similar to the first one, but this time it will include an "**Open**" button. Clicking this will run the app. You only need to do this once. After the first successful launch, the app can be opened normally by double-clicking it.

## ü§ñ AI Assistant

The AI Assistant panel provides a chat interface to help you with your workflow. It understands the application's current state and can perform actions on your behalf using natural language commands.

- **AI-Powered Actions (Tool Use)**: Beyond answering questions, the assistant can directly manipulate the UI and query project data. This allows for a powerful natural language workflow. Its capabilities include:

  - **Project Validation**: Ask it to `"validate my project for an annual glare simulation"` and it will check for common setup errors, such as a missing weather file or an incorrect viewpoint type, and report back any issues.

  - **Advanced Scene Manipulation**:
    - **Shading**: `"Add a 0.5 meter deep overhang to the south wall."`
    - **Sensor Grids**: `"Enable a sensor grid on the floor with 0.75m spacing."`
    - **Daylighting**: `"Enable continuous daylighting controls with a setpoint of 500 lux."`
  
  - **Simulation & Recipe Control**:
    - **Global Parameters**: `"Set the global ambient bounces to 5."`
    - **Recipe Configuration**: `"In the open illuminance recipe, change the time to 9:00 AM."`

  - **Results Analysis & Data Query**:
    - **Data Query**: `"What is the average illuminance for the current results?"` or `"How many points are above 500 lux?"`
    - **Time Scrubbing**: `"Show me the results for the winter solstice at noon."`
    - **Dashboard Control**: `"Open the glare rose diagram."`
  
  - **File Management**:
    - **Load Results**: `"Load a results file into dataset A."`
    - **Clear Results**: `"Clear all loaded results data."`

- **Proactive Suggestions**: The AI Assistant monitors user actions and provides contextual, non-intrusive suggestions to guide the workflow and prevent common errors. These suggestions appear as dismissible chips in the UI. For example:

  - After loading an **EPW weather file**, it will suggest opening an annual simulation recipe.

  - If a material's **reflectance is set to an unusually high or low value**, it will warn that this may be physically unrealistic.

  - If the user enables a **View Grid**, it will suggest opening the Imageless Annual Glare recipe.

  - If the **DGP recipe is open but the viewpoint is not set to fisheye**, it will offer to correct the setting.

### API Key Configuration

The integrated AI Assistant requires an API key to function. It can be configured to use Google Gemini or any model available through OpenRouter.

- **AI Configuration**: A settings modal allows you to select your preferred AI provider, choose from a list of models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Claude 3.7 Sonnet), and **enter your own API key for access**.

### Desktop Integration (Electron)

Ray Modeler operates as an Electron-based desktop application, enabling direct interaction with your file system.

- **Standardized Project Folder**: When you save a project, the application creates a complete, organized folder structure on your local machine.

- **Simulation Console**: A built-in console window appears when you run a simulation, showing the live output from the Radiance processes and reporting the final exit code (success or failure).

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers: Building from Source

You can run the application in a local development environment or build a distributable, single-click installer for macOS and Windows using `electron-builder`.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js and npm**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (npm is included).
- **Git**: [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Setup and Development

1. **Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ray-modeler.git](https://github.com/your-username/ray-modeler.git)
    
    # Navigate into the project directory
    cd ray-modeler
    
    # Install the necessary npm packages
    npm install

    # Update the npm packages
    npm update
    ```

2. **Run the App in Development Mode**

    To run the full Electron application with all features (including file system access and simulation execution), use the start script:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will launch the application in a development window with access to developer tools.

### Building for Distribution

The following commands use `electron-builder` to package the application into a distributable format. The final installer/application files will be located in the `dist/` directory.

#### Build for macOS üçé

This command bundles the application into a standard `.dmg` disk image for macOS.

```bash
npm run build:mac
```

#### Build for Windows üíª (from any platform)

This command creates NSIS installers (`.exe`) for both **x64** and **arm64** Windows architectures.

**Prerequisite for macOS/Linux users**: To build a Windows app on a non-Windows machine, you must have [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) installed. You can install it easily with Homebrew:

```Bash
brew install --cask wine-stable
```

Once Wine is installed, run the build script:

```Bash
npm run build:win
```

This will generate two installers in the dist/ folder, for example: Ray Modeler Setup 1.1.0-x64.exe and Ray Modeler Setup 1.1.0-arm64.exe.

### Cross-Platform Building

While it's recommended to build for a specific platform on that platform (e.g., build for Windows on a Windows machine), `electron-builder` supports cross-platform compilation with some setup:

- **Building for Windows on macOS/Linux**: Requires installing **Wine**.

- **Building for macOS on Windows/Linux**: Requires a macOS machine for code signing, so it's not practically feasible.

- **Building for Linux on macOS/Windows**: Can be done directly.

For detailed instructions on cross-platform builds, please refer to the [electron-builder documentation](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build).
